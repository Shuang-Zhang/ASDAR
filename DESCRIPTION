Description: A constructive approach for L0 penalized estimation in the sparse accelerated failure time (AFT) model with high-dimensional covariates. A computational algorithm that generates a sequence of solutions iteratively, based on active sets derived from primal and dual information and root fnding according to the KKT conditions.
